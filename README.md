# Arduino-sonar

For my VIN project, I will do an arduino sonar that will allow object detection. 
I will use a servo motor, which allows movement of 180 degrees, so that the sonar will be limited to 180 degrees. 
I will use an ultrasonic sensor HC-04 for sonar and a hobby servo for the servo motor.
The sensor will be fixed to the servo. Turning the sonar on and off will also be possible over the phone, which I will do via a bluetooth connection. 
It will also have 2 LED status lights, which will show the status of the sonar. 
To demonstrate the operation of sonar, I found a script on the Internet that draws the data that we send from the Arduino.
